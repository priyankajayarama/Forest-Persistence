Developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to analyze satellite imagery and detect forest persistence and deforestation trends using data from Google Earth Engine. Preprocessed large geospatial TIFF datasets with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy, and built a U-Net segmentation model in PyTorch for pixel-level forest classification. Trained and evaluated the model using IoU, Precision, and Recall metrics, and generated visualizations and masks to highlight forest loss patterns. Delivered data-driven insights through analysis and reporting to support environmental monitoring and decision-making.
